            <h2>More about me:</h2>
            <p>I have 6 years of experience working as a overseas salesperson for a local manufacturer who produces agricultural equipment. My daily job involves communicating with B2B buyers and lead generation. And I also have the opportunity to work with numerous internationally well-known industrial companies.</p>
            <p>Since I started learning web design and programming in early 2018, I always go back to all the industrial websites that impressed me most and study their site structure and user experience. All these efforts give me a unique perspective on how a professional manufacturer website should be presented, and how to build a better user experience so potential B2B customers are willing to move toward the purchase process.</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for a web designer with a background in manufacturing, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me. Apart from web design, I also provide services like product photography, graphic design, video editing.</p>
